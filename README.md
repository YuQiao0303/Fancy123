This is the official repository for the CVPR2025 paper: *''Fancy123: One Image to High-Quality 3D Mesh Generation via Plug-and-Play Deformation''* by Qiao Yu, Xianzhi Li, Yuan Tang, Xu Han, Long Hu, Yixue Hao and Min Chen.


Fancy123 generates a high-quality textured 3D mesh given a single RGB image:

Fancy123's core idea iw to utilize 2D image deformation to address the multiview inconsistency issue, and 3D mesh deformation to address the low fidelity issue:
